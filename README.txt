This is a fork of Tolgaatam's ColabTurtle.

It work perfectly well on a local machine too and I've added the ability to set a background image.


The original README is below but I'm using it a little differently on a local machine.

Installation
============

Open a new jupyter notebook and add a symlink to Turtle.py in the same folder as the notebook.

Use
===

import Turtle
Turtle.initializeTurtle()

Turtle.background_file = any file you like
